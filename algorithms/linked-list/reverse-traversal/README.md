# Reversed Linked List Traversal

The task is to traverse the given linked list in reversed order.

For example for the following linked list:

![](../../assets/Singly-linked-list.svg)

The order of traversal should be:

```text
37 → 99 → 12
```

The time complexity is `O(n)` because we visit every node only once.
